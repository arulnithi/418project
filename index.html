<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>

<p>We are going to implement a Python module which takes Python code and translates it to C++ code targeting a CUDA compiler for the execution of the code.</p>

<h3>
<a id="background" class="anchor" href="#background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background</h3>

<p>Python is a widely used, general purpose, interpreted programming language whose code allows users to express concepts in fewer lines of code as compared to C++ or Java. However, Python suffers from being slow due to its Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) which does not allow multi-threading. </p>

<p>To combat this, there are many libraries which exist to allow multi-threading in Python such as processing which is a fork based process creation tool and Cython which allows calls to C libraries for parallelism. Moreover, PyCuda allows the user to type in C as part of a larger Python program to harness the power of GPUs. However, most of these tools are either restricted by the GIL or require some form of C/C++ code on top of Python code. </p>

<p>Thus, we want to have a module which allows you to write standard Python syntax code and use just the methods of our module to harness the full potential of GPUs. </p>

<h4>
<a id="plan-to-achieve" class="anchor" href="#plan-to-achieve" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PLAN TO ACHIEVE</h4>

<p>We plan to have a completed Python module compiler which generates and compiles CUDA code for written Python code. The compiler should support arithmetic and boolean operations as well as libraries common to Python and C++.  </p>

<h4>
<a id="hope-to-achieve" class="anchor" href="#hope-to-achieve" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>HOPE TO ACHIEVE</h4>

<p>If we are able to complete the module compiler for CUDA, we plan to introduce finer level of control over the kernel calls in the compiler. We would also like to look into support for CPU parallelism by generating C++ code which uses OpenMP.</p>

<h3>
<a id="platform-choice" class="anchor" href="#platform-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Platform Choice</h3>

<p>We chose Python due to its simplicity and availability of multiple libraries for source code parsing. By having a module such as ParaPy, we hope to combine the simplicity of Python with the speed of C++.</p>

<p>We will be using the GHC 5000 machines with NVIDIA GPUs for design verification and testing since the NVIDIA compiler (nvcc) has already been set up on the machines.</p>

<h3>
<a id="schedule" class="anchor" href="#schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Schedule</h3>

<pre><code>####April 4 - 10
-Read and understand Python libraries which support processing of Python syntax grammar
-Write the parser functions using the Python libraries as the first step for our module

####April 11 - 17
-Generate CUDA kernel code without errors given Python function which meets basic requirements (only arithmetic operations and no function calls within a function)
-Work on checkpoint report

####April 18 - 24
-Compile module on the Mandelbrot function and compare speedup to standard Python implementation
-Produce graphs for comparison 

####April 25 - 30
-Add more functionality to support generic library calls for the compiler
-Start working on generating OpenMP code if times permits

####May 1 - 7

-Finalize the module compiler and fix any bugs
-Work on report and website
