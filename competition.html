<h3><b>ParaPy</b></h3> 

<p> ParaPy is a Python module which allows the user to write a Python function and run it on the GPU using the different options allowed. These options include parallelizing within a single Python function as well as standard operations such as map and reduce for a single Python function across a collection of elements.
</p>

<h3> <b>Introduction</b> </h3>
<p>
  <b>ParaPy</b> is able to use the NVIDA GPU present in a system due to its 3-stage process. It first breaks down the Python function into its syntax tree using the in-built ast module. Secondly, it uses the elements of the tree to re-construct a CUDA function based on option passed in. Lastly, it will compile and run the newly created CUDA function in a separate file. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Goal:</b> To provide a simple interface to allow the user to use data parallel models to increase performance by parallelizing across the GPU while only writing functions in standard Python syntax.
</p>

<h3> <b>Current Results</b> </h3>
<p>
  <b>1)</b> We are able to allow the user to parallelize for loops in their Python function using the GPU. 
</p>

<p> 

<b>2)</b> We are able to allow the user to map a Python function to a collection of elements using the GPU.
