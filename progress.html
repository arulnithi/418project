<p><strong>Read and understood Python libraries which support processing of Python syntax grammar to parse simple functions</strong></p>

<p>Our current program now allows us to parse simple python code using the python ast and inspect modules. We are able to break down the function into its full syntax tree. However, due to the limitations of the ast module, and the innate differences between Python and C++, the conversion process is not straightforward. One example is that the ast module does not recognize parentheses, thus mathematical instructions that require operations inside parentheses to be completed first will not be translated correctly. </p>

<p>To overcome this, we found a astor module, which is a newer module with additional functionality. We need to work integrating this into our current program.</p>

<p><strong>Started to write the formatter class to convert parsed Python code to C++ code</strong></p>

<p>We started work on the formatter class to convert the parsed function into C++, CUDA and OpenMp code. We have finishing handling the conversion to C++ code and have verified that it compiles. Our current program is able to handle calls to the math library, arithmetic operations and simple assignments. </p>

<p><strong>Configured and Understood the semantics of CUDA</strong></p>

<p>We have also read through various examples of CUDA functions as well as understood what is needed for CUDA to compile. This will help us as we try to format the parsed code into a CUDA file.</p>

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><b>Currently Working On</b></h2>

<p><strong>Generate CUDA kernel code without errors given Python function which meets basic requirements (only arithmetic operations and no function calls within a function)</strong></p>

<p>We are currently working on getting our parser to work on a broader set of functions. Since we want to generate CUDA kernel code for Python functions which have high arithmetic intensity and scope for parallel implementation. An example of such a function would be to mapping a computationally intensive function onto a large array. We are working towards successfully generating C++ code and CUDA kernel code for such a function by this week.</p>

      <h2>
<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><b>Deliverable</b></h2>

<p><strong>Compile module on the Mandelbrot function and compare speedup to standard Python implementation</strong></p>

<p>We will be slightly behind our projected schedule for working on this item. However, we understand this to be our main achievement goal for this project. This is will really test the validity of what we have worked on in the previous weeks and we foresee having to go back and make many adjustments. Hence we believe that if we can achieve this target, we can start to tweak our project for better speed up, larger scope of functions and adding OpenMP functionality, which are our stretch goals.</p>
