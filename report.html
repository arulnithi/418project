</h3>

<p>ParaPy is a Python module which allows the user to write a Python function and run it on the GPU using different options. These options include parallelizing by unravelling for loops as well as standard operations such as map across a collection of elements.</p>



<h3>
	<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background
</h3>

<p>Python is a simple and elegant language which usually requires lesser lines of code as compared to C or C++. However, Python is extremely slow in its execution due to its Global Interpreter Lock which makes parallelization of code hard. Currently, Python has some process-based and fork-based parallel libraries available. It, does not have any modules which allow the user to utilize the system's GPU.</p>

<p>Thus, ParaPy is a module which enables the user to harness the GPU without having to write any CUDA or C++ code. Using just a normal Python function, ParaPy is able to re-compile the function as a CUDA kernel and execute it.</p>



<h3>
	<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Approach
</h3>

<p>Our approach involved breaking down the problem into 3 parts. We first had to take the Python function and understand its syntax. This would facilitate the idea that the user does not have to modify his Python code for the GPU. With that understanding, we had to then reformat the function into the appropriate type of code. This would usually be a .cu file. Lastly, our module would automate the compilation and execution of the newly generated file.</p>

<p>This is summarized with the following diagram:</p>

</div>

<p><b>Parser:</b> The Parser class would take the Python function and using the AST and Inspect modules, break down the function into nodes based on the syntax. This is the same first step in the Python compiler's process. Thereafter, each node would be parsed and translated into a line of C++ code. This was done for the full function with the idea of supporting as much of Python as possible. It would output a list of strings, where each element would be a converted line of code.</p>

<p><b>Formatter:</b> The Formatter class would then taken this list of strings, and based on the flag passed in (CPP, CUDA_FOR, CUDA_MAP), it would generate a complete file with a CUDA kernel corresponding to the Python code as well as a main function which would have the appropriate cudaMalloc, cudaMemcpy and cudaFree for the CUDA kernel.</p>

<p><b>Compiler:</b> The Compiler class would take the generated file and compile it. It would also use the blockSize specified if any. This is where the user interfaces with our module since all flags are passed in here.</p>

</div>

<p>Based on the example above, it can be seen that the user has to make minimal changes to the Python code and the Compiler method is invoked on the function with blockSize and array length speicifed.</p>
